    "content": "Split Learning is a distributed machine learning technique where a neural network is split between client and server. The client processes data up to a 'cut layer' and sends activations (not raw data) to the server. This preserves privacy while enabling training on distributed data. I compared three variants: Vanilla SL (sequential), U-Shaped SL (client keeps first and last layers), and SplitFed (combines split learning with federated averaging)."
